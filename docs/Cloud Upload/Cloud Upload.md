### Uploading to the cloud

xDrip+ supports the following methods for uploading to the cloud:

* `MongoDB` -- If you're using MongoLab and Azure this should be enabled.
* `Nightscout Sync (REST-API)` -- The REST-API is an alternative to direct mongodb upload.
* `InfluxDB` -- If you are using a private InfluxDB database, this should be enabled.
* `Dexcom Share Server Upload` -- Upload data to Dexcom's Servers so you can use your data with Dexcom's apps.
