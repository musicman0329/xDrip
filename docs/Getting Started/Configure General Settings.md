### General Settings

After installing xDrip+ on your phone, you will want to set your target range and glucose units. To configure these settings, go to `Settings` > `Glucose Units`. From there, you can set the following.

* `Glucose Units` -- Available options are `mg/dL` or `mmol/L`.
* `High Value` -- xDrip+ will alert once blood glucose levels cross this threshhold.
* `Low Value` -- xDrip+ will alert once blood glucose levels cross this threshhold.
