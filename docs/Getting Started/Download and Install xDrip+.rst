**How to install xDrip+**

1. Download the latest nightly from the link above onto your phone. 
2. In order to install the app, you have to allow the installation of apps from "untrusted sources" (i.e., not from the Google Play Store). This setting is usually in the "Security" section of your phone's settings.
3. Open your phone's "Downloads" app. You should see the .apk file that you downloaded in Step 1.
4. Tap the file, and follow the on-screen prompts. 
5. Once the installation finishes, press "open" to launch the app.
