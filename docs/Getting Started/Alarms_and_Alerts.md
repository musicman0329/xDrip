#### Glucose Level Alerts List

This is where you can configure alerts for various BG levels. You can create two types of alerts: *Low Alerts* and *High Alerts*. 

* To create a *Low Alert*, tap the `Create Low Alert` button. A screeen will pop up with the following variables:
  * `Alert Name` -- The name of the alert (i.e. "Low Alert")
  * `Threshold` -- This sets the threshold for the alert. Since this a *Low Alert*, xDrip+ will alert when glucose values drop below this threshold.
  * `Default Snooze` -- This setting tells xDrip+ how long to wait to re-alert if the alert is snoozed. The default is 30 minutes.
  * `Re-raise every x minutes if unacknowledged` -- If you do not acknowledge the alert, xDrip will continue re-alert every x minutes until the alert is acknowledged. 
  * `Alert Tone` -- This setting allows you to set a custom tone for this alert. 
  * `Select time for alert` -- You can set a custom timeframe for each alert. The default is `all day`.
  * `Overide phone Silent Mode` -- On by default. This setting allows xDrip+ to override the "Do Not Disturb" feature on Android phones.
  * `Vibrate on alert` -- On by default. xDrip+ will vibrate as well as play an audible tone.
  * `Disable alert` -- Checking this box will disable the alert. You can reenable the alert by unchecking this box.
  * To test your alert, tap the `Test Alert` button. Once you are satisfied with your alert, tap the `Save Alert` button, and you will be returned to the Alert List.

* To create a *High Alert*, tap the `Create High Alert` button. A screeen will pop up with the following variables:
  * `Alert Name` -- The name of the alert (i.e. "Low Alert")
  * `Threshold` -- This sets the threshold for the alert. Since this a *Low Alert*, xDrip+ will alert when glucose values drop below this threshold.
  * `Default Snooze` -- This setting tells xDrip+ how long to wait to re-alert if the alert is snoozed. The default is 120 minutes.
  * `Re-raise every x minutes if unacknowledged` -- If you do not acknowledge the alert, xDrip will continue re-alert every x minutes until the alert is acknowledged. 
  * `Alert Tone` -- This setting allows you to set a custom tone for this alert. 
  * `Select time for alert` -- You can set a custom timeframe for each alert. The default is `all day`.
  * `Overide phone Silent Mode` -- On by default. This setting allows xDrip+ to override the "Do Not Disturb" feature on Android phones.
  * `Vibrate on alert` -- On by default. xDrip+ will vibrate as well as play an audible tone.
  * `Disable alert` -- Checking this box will disable the alert. You can reenable the alert by unchecking this box.
  * To test your alert, tap the `Test Alert` button. Once you are satisfied with your alert, tap the `Save Alert` button, and you will be returned to the Alert List.
  
To delete an existing alert, press and hold on the alert you wish to remove. A window with the alert settings will pop up. Scroll to the bottom and tap `Remove Alert` to delete it.
